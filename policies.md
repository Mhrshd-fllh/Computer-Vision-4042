# Course Policies

## 1) Passing Requirement (Minimum Passing Score)
Since this is an elective course, to pass the course you must obtain **at least 50% of the total score of the Midterm and Final exams combined**.

---

## 2) Grading Policy
The total course grade is based on the following components:

- **Midterm Exam:** 4 points  
- **Final Exam:** 5 points  
- **Homework Assignments:** 7 points  
- **Quizzes:** 2 points  
- **Course Project:** 2 points  

---

## 3) Attendance
Attendance is **not mandatory**.

---

## 4) Communication
Course communications will be handled via:
- **Email**
- **Telegram group**

For homework-related questions, please ask in the **Telegram group** so that the answers can benefit everyone.

---

## 5) Homework Submission Format
- Submit your answers as a **single compressed ZIP file**.
- Naming format:
  `HW_{HW_Number}_StudentID.zip`

### Report Format
- **Theoretical questions:** must be written **by hand on paper**.
- **Practical questions:** create **one PDF per question** containing:
  - code report / explanation,
  - answers to the questions asked in the practical part,
  - and if the implementation is from scratch, include an explanation of the implementation as well.

**Important notes:**
- Reports must be written by the student. Reports generated using **language models** are not acceptable.
- Make sure the practical report answers the questions explicitly, not just code screenshots.

---

## 6) Use of External Resources and Citation
If you use any external resource (e.g., other people’s solutions or AI tools), you must **clearly cite the source at the beginning of your answer**.

If this is detected, students may be asked to **present and explain** their solution.

---

## 7) Academic Integrity
- Copying other students’ assignments **without meaningful changes**, or submitting someone else’s work with only changing the name:
  - **First time:** homework score will be **zero**
  - **Repeated offense:** may lead to **course removal**

Please avoid any form of misconduct.

---

## 8) Homework Timing and Late Policy
Each assignment is designed with respect to its deadline; therefore, do **not** postpone solving the homework to the last days.

### Allowed Late Days
- Each homework has **up to 3 days** of allowed late submission.
- In total, you have **7 late days** across all homeworks during the semester.

### Bonus Late Time (Early Submission)
If you submit an assignment **before the deadline** and obtain **at least 70%** of the assignment score, up to **24 hours** may be added to your allowed late time.

### After Late Allowance Ends
After exceeding the overall late allowance, for **each hour of delay**, **1%** of your homework grade will be deducted.

---

## 9) Grading Objections
Homework grading follows predefined rubrics.  
Therefore, objections to the **point distribution** of each question/section will **not** be accepted.

Please avoid unnecessary objections or creating tension in the course group.

---

## 10) Presentations (Oral Defense)
During the semester, you may be selected multiple times to present your solutions.

### Selection Process
- If you score **above 80** in an assignment and your work is suspected of similarity (or randomly selected), you may be asked to present that assignment.

### Format and Schedule
- Presentations may be **hybrid (in-person or online)** based on student preference.
- Presentation time slots:
  - **Saturdays and Mondays, 12:00–14:30**

### Presentation Grading
No objections regarding presentation grades will be accepted. Presentation scores are assigned carefully and are final.

## 11) Feedback Forms
At the end of each homework and each week, a Google Form feedback survey may be sent.  
Please share your feedback, suggestions, and criticisms through the form whenever possible.
